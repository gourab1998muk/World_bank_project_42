Note however that, according to the The Fourth National Communication of Albania on Climate Change (2022), “several types of constraints and gaps have been noted in the observation and monitoring system. It is critical to (…) upgrade and modernize hydro-meteorological observation networks, data management and forecasting systems, as well as providing sustainable organizational, human and technical resources to maintain and operate them. To support risk assessment and early warning systems, and promote operational monitoring, warning, forecasting and mapping of meteorological, hydrological and climate-related hazards, there is a need to establish and invest in fully operational 24/7 hydro-meteorological services (technical and human resources). It is also necessary to strengthen the early warning capacity with a multi-hazard approach and engender enhanced cooperation with the National Agency for Civil Protection and other key stakeholders”.

Also, the need to establish early warning systems for all sectors by developing a unified database is underlined in the Egypt National Climate Change Strategy 2050 (2022).

While there are several sustainability initiatives—such as promoting energy-efficient technologies in public infrastructure, including energy-efficient lighting, district cooling systems, and green building certifications under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)—these remain voluntary and are not consistently enforced across public procurements. Therefore, environmental considerations are currently encouraged rather than mandated.

The SPP Policy 2023 has been enacted and this policy is based on three pillars—economic, environmental, and social—and emphasises integrating sustainability into public procurement. However, this has not yet been implemented and work is being done to amend the Public Procurement Act 2006 (PPA 2006) and Public Procurement Rules 2008 (PPR 2008) to incorporate SPP policies.

The budget classification and chart of accounts (…)should be updated to easily track climate resilience expenditures as well as recovery and reconstruction spending by source, location and economic activity”.

All priority infrastructure projects have been rated against these objectives, including climate resilience, to ensure the overall alignment of IDP investments with IDP objectives. But, in practice, it is unclear how much weight is given to climate resilience in the project prioritization and selection process”.

The IMF thus recommends to “establish standard methodology for investment project appraisal and selection and build climate resilience into project screening and design process”.

The Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap (2023-2026) promotes the integration of environmental social governance safeguards into investment strategies. “A recent review of operations has led to the ongoing integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into our investment strategies. Building in environmental safeguards to investment decisions helps evaluate environmental risk FSM is facing and how FSM is managing those risks. These considerations foster a better understanding of climate polices, energy use, waste, pollution, natural resource conservation. Investment appraisal and decision making is then better informed about how to harness environmental benefits and avoid environmental harm.” But no details on specific activities undertaken in this regard.",https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/CR/2019/1FSMEA2019002.ashx; https://dofa.gov.fm/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PFM-Reform-Roadmap-2023-2026.pdf,1.0,

Further, the Environmental Protection and Management Law addresses various environmental issues, including environmental impact assessment (EIA) guidelines and standards. The EIA requirements do not specifically mandate the impacts of the proposed activity on climate change. However, since the EIA is required for developments in keysectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, fisheries, industries, wastes, health, and trade (transportation), the process is expected to consider the impact of development on these sectors, covered by Liberia’s revised NDC. Nonetheless, the assessment of the scope of application of the ESIA requirements across all sectors is yet to be holistic, and reviews and reports from several sectors point to the weak implementation of the framework. Revising the EIA guidelines to incorporate NDC considerations during the screening of requests would facilitate the achievement of NDC targets.

In 2022 the Digital Climate Atlas of Serbia was launched. 
The Digital Climate Atlas is an online platform which provides comprehensive and freely available information about climate changes and their consequences in Serbia. The Digital Climate Atlas allows to monitor a large number of variables – temperature, precipitation as well as specific values such as the length of heat waves or the number of frosty days, at the level of the entire country, region or each individual municipality. All climate data presented in the Digital Climate Atlas of Serbia is publicly available and can be used by different stakeholders for vulnerability and risk assessments, as well as for identification of adaptation options at sectoral, subnational and national levels.

Energy efficiency must be considered by EU countries in all relevant policy and major investment decisions taken in the energy and non-energy sectors.

The revised directive entered into force on 10 October 2023.

At the national level, Green Public Procurement (GPP) is mandated by the Public Sector Contracts Law (Ley de Contratos del Sector Público), enacted in 2017. This law requires the inclusion of environmental criteria in public procurement processes, particularly focusing on energy efficiency, sustainable materials, and the lifecycle costs of products and services.

For instance, in public construction contracts, the law mandates that bidders must prove their technical capacity through environmental certifications (such as ISO 14001) and that at least one of the execution conditions must focus on environmental protection, like waste management or energy efficiency measures.

The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2018) sets several objectives related to climate risk information such as to “enhance the collection, analysis and use of climate change related data to inform vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning and decision-making” as well as to “enable effective information management and sharing” of climate change related data, and “establish agro-meteorological stations and early warning system for key hazards, including drought, floods and hurricanes”.

The 2023 GCF Readiness proposal states “the decentralized and limited availability of climate data and evidence”. It thus intends to create a centralized digital platform and repository that allows for the collection, storage and analysis of climate data and evidence, which will give access to the the Saint Kitts and Nevis Meteorological Service’s website to be developed.
